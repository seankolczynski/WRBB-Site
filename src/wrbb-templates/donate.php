            <p class="donate-text">WRBB 104.9FM started out its life as WNEU in December of 1962, and for nearly 60 years, we continue to be a cornerstone of music culture at Northeastern University. In its current iteration, WRBB is still a completely student-run and freeform radio station that strives to offer students and members of the community with the best in independent radio. With nearly 200 students involved in a multitude of functions ranging from broadcasting to graphic design, WRBB is an interdisciplinary hub where students who love music can come together as one. Consider making a donation today to help fund our passion for music, radio, and much more</p>
