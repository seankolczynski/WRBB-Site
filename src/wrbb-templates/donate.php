                WRBB 104.9FM started out its life as WNEU in December of 1962, and for nearly 60 years, we continue to be a cornerstone of music culture at Northeastern University. In its current iteration, WRBB is still a completely student-run and freeform radio station that strives to offer students and members of the community with the best in independent radio.
            </p>
